# Introduction

## Summary

Remote sensing is a science that uses electromagnetic radiation as a medium to identify surface features and apply surface information to relevant fields [@Ranganath2007]. Various sensors function like human eyes that can perceive a broader range of spectral bands, providing richer and more extensive ground information, thus laying the foundation for further analysis.

### Active and Passive Remote Sensing

@fig-comparison and @tbl-comparison demonstate the differences between active and passive remote sensing in terms of working principles, advantages and applications.

| Energy Source | Sensor-generated energy                                                  | Relies on surface radiation                                 |
+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
| Advantages    | -   Independent of surface radiation, unaffected by lighting conditions. | -   Can cover large areas simultaneously.                   |
|               |                                                                          |                                                             |
|               | -   Can penetrate clouds, vegetation, etc.                               | -   High revisit rate,capable of providing time-series data |
