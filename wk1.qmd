# Introduction

## Summary

Remote sensing is a science that uses electromagnetic radiation as a medium to identify surface features and apply surface information to relevant fields [@Ranganath2007]. Various sensors function like human eyes that can perceive a broader range of spectral bands, providing richer and more extensive ground information, thus laying the foundation for further analysis.

### Active and Passive Remote Sensing

@fig-comparison and @tbl-comparison demonstate the differences between active and passive remote sensing in terms of working principles, advantages and applications.

### Interaction with Earth's Surface

As @fig-interaction shows, solar radiation undergoes a series of interactions at the Earth's surface, such as cloud scattering, surface scattering, and atmospheric absorption. The energy ultimately received by the sensor is the result of these combined processes, representing rich information while also potentially introducing interference to the research. For example, atmospheric correction is required in the preprocessing of remote sensing images because the energy received by the sensor is affected by atmospheric scattering and absorption, leading to reduced image contrast.

### Four Types of Resolution

Typically, the design of remote sensing sensors requires a trade-off between these four types of resolution based on their primary application areas. For example, high spatial resolution often comes at the cost of a smaller coverage area, which results in a longer revisit period, meaning lower temporal resolution. Additionally, due to technical constraints such as data transmission, spatial resolution and spectral resolution cannot be simultaneously maximized.
