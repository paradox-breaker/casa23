# Data Correction and Enhancement

## Summary

### Data Organization

#### Format Conversion

If specific software is required for image analysis, it is necessary to select a format compatible with that software.

#### Image Mosaicking

Since single images usually cover limited areas, and sometimes a study area spans across two adjacent scenes, it is necessary to mosaic two images.

~fun="mean" means calculating the average value in overlapping areas.~

This section selects an area near the city of Huzhou, China. The final true-color image after mosaicking has a smooth transition without noticeable seams.

Sometimes, when the pixel values in the overlapping areas of two images differ significantly, the seam may become prominent. In such cases, feathering techniques need to be applied.

#### Image Clipping

Since the coverage of remote sensing images is large, processing and analyzing the entire image may result in unnecessarily computation. Therefore, image clipping is necessary.

For example, if I want to classify land cover in Anji County, I can use the boundary vector data to clip the image.

I can also determine a threshold based on NDVI values to extract vegetation.

### Data Correction

#### Radiometric Calibration

Since the sensor receives digital signals, it is necessary to convert them to radiometric units with physical significance, such as radiance. The gain and bias can be obtained from the sensor metadata.

#### Geometric Correction

Geometric correction mainly consists of two parts:

-   Establishing a mapping relationship between the image to be corrected and the reference image based on selected control points.

-   Resampling the image.

The choice of resampling method depends on the specific application. For example, nearest neighbor resampling is suitable for classification tasks, while cubic interpolation is more appropriate for image analysis.

#### Atmospheric Correction

Atmospheric correction is the process of removing atmospheric effects to restore surface reflectance. The necessity of atmospheric correction depends on the specific application. For example:

-   Land cover classification does not necessarily require atmospheric correction.

-   Quantitative parameter extraction requires it for accurate results.

: Absolute Calibration VS Relative Calibration

### Image Enhancement

Image enhancement refers to the process of improving image quality and highlighting key information using processing techniques. It can be used for smoothing and denoising, edge detection, and contrast enhancement, making images more suitable for observation and analysis.

## Application

Radiometric calibration, geometric correction and atmospheric correction fall within the scope of remote sensing data preprocessing. The flowchart below intuitively illustrates the position of these three steps in practical remote sensing data applications.

```{r echo = FALSE warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

# 定义节点数据
nodes <- data.frame(
  label = c("Surface Reflection or Radiation", " Atmospheric Transmission ", "Photoelectric Conversion", "A/D Conversion", " Information Encoding", " Digital Transmission","Ground Decoding","Radiometric Correction","Geometric Correction","Atmospheric Correction","Remote Sensing Model Inversion","Derived Parameters"),
  x = c(0, 2, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0,2,4,4,2,0), 
  y = c(0, 0, 0, -0.2, -0.2, -0.2,-0.4,-0.4,-0.4,-0.6,-0.6,-0.6)
)

edges <- data.frame(
  x = c(0, 2, 4, 4, 2, 0 ,0,2,4,4,2,0),
  y = c(0, 0, 0, -0.2, -0.2, -0.2,-0.4,-0.4,-0.4,-0.6,-0.6,-0.6),  
  xend = c(2, 4, 4, 2, 0, 0,2,4,4,2,0,0),
  yend = c(0, 0, -0.2, -0.2, -0.2,-0.4,-0.4,-0.4,-0.6,-0.6,-0.6,-0.6)  
)

ggplot() +

  geom_segment(data = edges, aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend), 
               arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.02, "cm")), size = 0.5) +  

  geom_tile(data = nodes, aes(x = x, y = y), width = 1.8, height = 0.1, fill = "lightblue", color = "black") +
  
  geom_text(data = nodes, aes(x = x, y = y), label = nodes$label, size = 2.7) +
 
  theme_void() 
```

Currently, many fields that use remote sensing data rely on Level-2 (L2) data because it has already undergone basic radiometric calibration and atmospheric correction, making it ready for direct analysis. For example, in multi-temporal analyses such as land use change and vegetation cover monitoring, standardized Level-2 data eliminates atmospheric interference, enhancing comparability and reducing the need for user preprocessing.

Of course, not all research requires preprocessed data. For instance, some studies focus on atmospheric analysis or the development and testing of new correction algorithms, in which case more raw data would be more suitable.

Compared to image correction, the application of image enhancement is relatively more concentrated, primarily focusing on visual enhancement and improving readability. For example, when using ENVI software for land cover classification, if the acquired image has a narrow spectral range that affects manual interpretation, stretching is needed to facilitate land cover recognition and build a reasonable training set. It is important to note that image stretching is mainly used to enhance details and typically does not alter the original pixel values. However, if the enhanced image is to be applied in further analysis, more caution is required, as the enhancement method should improve image contrast and edge information while preserving the original reflectance values [@Kaplan21].

@Ramzan2025 fused Landsat 8 and Landsat 9 imagery to enhance the accuracy of crop classification and applied image enhancement after fusion to emphasize texture variations and spectral differences. Clearly, this step is crucial for precise classification, as it highlights key features and improves subsequent classification accuracy.

## Reflection

### Real-time Processing

Some application areas, such as emergency response in natural disasters, have high real-time requirements. It is crucial to rapidly acquire and analyze image data of affected areas to improve response efficiency. The widespread adoption of UAVs provides a continuous data input source for real-time processing.

Currently, research has demonstrated the feasibility of implementing edge computing on UAVs to directly perform classification tasks, enabling real-time data monitoring. This approach is also applicable to real-time image correction and enhancement, facilitating the efficient execution of subsequent tasks [@Daniel2022]. However, this field still faces challenges related to cost and computational overhead. Therefore, further research is needed to optimize algorithms and improve model accuracy.
