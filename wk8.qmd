# Classification Ⅱ

## Summary

### Object-Based Image Analysis

Object-Based Image Analysis divides an image into small regions—called superpixels—based on the similarity of pixel characteristics such as color, texture, and spatial location, and then performs classification. The use of superpixels can reduce computational load and enhance the preservation of spatial structural information.

Currently, the SLIC algorithm is one of the most commonly used methods for generating superpixels.

```{r echo = FALSE,warning=FALSE}
library(DiagrammeR)

grViz("
digraph flowchart {
  graph [layout = dot, rankdir = TB]

  Step0 [label = 'Initialize a set of center points as superpixel centers', shape = box]
  Step1 [label = 'Calculate the spatial distance and color (feature) difference between each pixel and the center points', shape = box]
  Step2 [label = 'Assign each pixel to the nearest center to form superpixels', shape = box]
  Step3 [label = 'Update the center points based on the current superpixels', shape = box]
  Step4 [label = 'Repeat the process iteratively to obtain an optimal segmentation result', shape = box]
 
  Step0 -> Step1 -> Step2 -> Step3 -> Step4
}
")
```

It is important to note that OBIA is less suitable for images with a high proportion of mixed pixels or unclear geometric structure.

### Sub-pixel Analysis

This method assumes that the reflectance of each pixel is a linear combination of the reflectance values of several spectral endmembers—the pure spectral signatures of single land cover types.

In applications, most pixels are mixed. If too many endmembers are selected, the computational cost becomes high; if too few are used, the representation of land cover types may be inaccurate.

@fig-sub shows the result of sub-pixel analysis of Dar-es-salaam based on Landsat 8 imagery. The endmembers include urban, vegetation, and water. Since only three endmembers were selected, the categories can be visually distinguished by directly mapping them to RGB channels.

@fig-subclass shows the classified image obtained by filtering based on the proportion of each endmember.

### Accuracy Assessment

#### Confusion Matrix

In some cases, Producer’s Accuracy (PA) is more important—better to overkill than overlook

In other situations, User’s Accuracy (UA) matters more (e.g. spam emails filtering).

#### Kappa

Kappa focuses on whether the model's predictive performance is better than random guessing, making it a stricter metric than OA. However, when class imbalance exists, Kappa may easily give a more pessimistic evaluation than the model's actual performance.

### Model Performance Evaluation

#### Discriminative Ability (AUROC)

The ROC curve illustrates the trade-off between TPR and FPR as the classification threshold changes. Typically, increasing TPR also leads to an increase in FPR.

AUROC is the area under the ROC curve. In general, a model’s ROC curve lies between the diagonal line (AUROC = 0.5, representing random guessing) and the ideal curve (AUROC = 1).

#### Generalization Performance (Cross Validation)

K-Fold Cross Validation: In each iteration, 1/k of the dataset is used as the test set, and the remaining (k−1)/k is used for training. This is repeated k times.

Leave-One-Out Cross Validation is a special case of K-Fold where k equals the total number of samples, making it suitable for small datasets.

##### Spatial Cross Validation

Before cross-validation, the data is first clustered based on spatial proximity to form folds. This ensures that the training and test sets are spatially separated, avoiding “spatial cheating”.

## Application

### Object-Based Classification

In practical applications, object-based land cover classification is more suitable for high-resolution imagery and study areas with significant human activity, such as urban environments and farmland. This is because high-resolution imagery often reveals clearer geometric structures of land features, and human activities tend to create distinct boundaries. In contrast, mixed pixels caused by low spatial resolution and blurred boundaries due to interlaced vegetation growth can make image segmentation and classification more difficult.

There is abundant literature demonstrating the accuracy of object-based land cover classification in urban studies. For example, @kutz2022object used high-resolution remote sensing data to perform land cover classification and change detection in the Baltimore area. The study showed that land cover maps generated using object-based classification for the years 1999 and 2004 achieved high accuracy. Moreover, compared to pixel-based methods, the object-based approach performed better in detecting land cover changes.

However, this does not mean that object-based land cover classification lacks value in natural landscape classification. Certain algorithms can be used to assist in superpixel segmentation. For instance, image texture features extracted using Gabor filters can be employed to improve the accuracy of segmentation methods [@kutz2022object].

### Sub-pixel Analysis

Sub-pixel analysis can be used to improve classification accuracy in heterogeneous areas. It can also estimate the proportional coverage of different land cover types within each pixel, enabling the calculation of land cover composition over larger spatial scales to support environmental management and urban planning.

For example, @asner2005desertification used sub-pixel analysis based on hyperspectral data to estimate the surface proportions of photosynthetic vegetation, non-photosynthetic vegetation, and bare soil in northern Chihuahua. This was done to assess the impacts of desertification on plant growth, ecosystem processes, and the carbon cycle. Clearly, a greater number of spectral bands can effectively reduce spectral overlap between different surface components, thereby improving the accuracy of the analysis.
