    "text": "1.1 Summary\nRemote sensing is a science that uses electromagnetic radiation as a medium to identify surface features and apply surface information to relevant fields (Navalgund, Jayaraman, and Roy 2007). Various sensors function like human eyes that can perceive a broader range of spectral bands, providing richer and more extensive ground information, thus laying the foundation for further analysis.",
