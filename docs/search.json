Various sensors function like human eyes that can perceive a broader range of spectral bands, providing richer and more extensive ground information, thus laying the foundation for further analysis.",

The energy ultimately received by the sensor is the result of these combined processes, representing rich information while also potentially introducing interference to the research. For example, atmospheric correction is required in the preprocessing of remote sensing images because the energy received by the sensor is affected by atmospheric scattering and absorption, leading to reduced image contrast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.2: Interaction with Earth’s Surface\n\n\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Four Types of Resolution\nTypically, the design of remote sensing sensors requires a trade-off between these four types of resolution based on their primary application areas. For example, high spatial resolution often comes at the cost of a smaller coverage area, which results in a longer revisit period, meaning lower temporal resolution. Additionally, due to technical constraints such as data transmission, spatial resolution and spectral resolution cannot be simultaneously maximized.\n\nDefinitions of the Four Types of Resolution in Remote Sensing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResolution Type\n Definition\n\n\n\n\nSpatial Resolution\nThe smallest ground unit distinguishable by the sensor, which corresponds to the size of a raster pixel.\n\n\nSpectral Resolution\nThe number and width of spectral bands that the sensor can detect.\n\n\nTemporal Resolution\nThe revisit cycle of the sensor.\n\n\nRadiometric Resolution\nThe smallest detectable energy variation by the sensor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNavalgund, Ranganath R., V.
