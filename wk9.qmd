# SAR

## Summary

SAR observes Earth's surface by receiving backscattered signals. It is called “synthetic aperture” radar because, as it moves, it collects data from different positions over the same ground area. Subtle differences in the phase and intensity of these multiple observations allow for precise reconstruction of image details, thereby improving spatial resolution—essentially simulating a much longer antenna.

Radar signals respond differently to various surface types depending on the polarization mode. For surface roughness analysis, VV polarization is typically used. For detecting volume scattering from structurally loose objects like tree canopies, VH or HV polarization is more appropriate.

### Change Detection from Image Collections

#### Statistical Testing

A t-test can be applied.

@fig-t2020 shows t-test results of SAR data before and after the Beirut port explosion. @fig-t2019 shows a control test with the date shifted to 2019, noticeably fewer regions show significant change (yellow), indicating that much of the change observed in @fig-t2020 is due to the explosion.

#### Standard Deviation

Changed pixels will typically exhibit higher standard deviation over a certain period. By setting a threshold, it is possible to identify changed pixels.

## Application

Due to its all-weather, all-day imaging capability and a certain degree of penetration, SAR is widely used for monitoring surface changes and has found broad applications across various fields, such as disaster management, infrastructure monitoring, agricultural management, ocean observation, archaeology, and heritage conservation.

### Ocean Observation

In the field of ocean monitoring, SAR can be used to measure water depth. By analyzing the amplitude and phase of the backscattered signals, SAR is capable of monitoring ocean currents and wave patterns, and further deriving wind speed and direction over the sea surface.

In addition, SAR is highly sensitive to the reflective characteristics of oil films on the ocean surface, making it useful for oil spill detection. This contributes to timely response in oil pollution incidents, helps maintain marine ecosystem health, and protects the well-being of coastal populations.

Moreover, SAR can effectively detect ships under various weather conditions, which plays a critical role in combating illegal fishing, smuggling, and other unlawful maritime activities. It enhances the safety of maritime navigation and supports the sustainable management of marine resources [@Asiyabi2023].

### Agricultural Management

In the field of agricultural management, @Rei2019 utilized VH and VV polarized SAR data acquired by ASNARO-2 (X-band) and Sentinel-1 (C-band) to classify crops in Japan's Tokachi Plain, aiming to explore the potential of such data combinations for crop mapping. The study evaluated classification results using ASNARO-2 XSAR, Sentinel-1 C-SAR, and a combination of both data sources.

The results showed that XSAR data performed better in identifying sugar beet and potato fields, while C-SAR was more suitable for detecting large wheat fields. The complementary use of both datasets helped reduce misclassifications.

The study also revealed that different polarization modes have varying penetration capabilities depending on the crop type, suggesting that polarimetric analysis may be useful for future crop identification.

## Reflection

#### SAR Noise

As an active remote sensing technology, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) also has its limitations. Unlike optical remote sensing, which relies on incoherent imaging—recording only the total energy received per pixel—SAR uses coherent imaging, which records both the amplitude and phase of the backscattered signal. Optical sensors depend on natural sunlight, which is incoherent and randomly phased, whereas SAR systems actively emit and receive microwave signals.

Because of this, SAR imagery often contains distinct interference patterns caused by the coherent summation of signals from many small scatterers within a pixel. This phenomenon is known as speckle noise. Speckle can distort pixel values and texture information and significantly reduce image interpretability and visual clarity. Therefore, speckle reduction is a critical preprocessing step in SAR applications.

Two commonly used techniques for mitigating speckle are multi-looking and filtering, both of which are essentially based on averaging. Multi-looking involves averaging backscatter values from slightly different viewing geometries, while filtering averages pixel values within a spatial neighborhood.

#### SAR Bands

Among the various SAR frequency bands, the C-band is currently the most widely used in research and operational applications. This is partly due to its data accessibility—for example, Sentinel-1 provides large volumes of open-access C-band data with high temporal frequency. Additionally, the C-band offers strong general-purpose performance, balancing penetration capability with spatial resolution.

However, different SAR frequency bands exhibit different penetration depths and scattering characteristics, and each has its own advantages depending on the application. For example, in crop classification, the C-band is currently the most commonly used in agricultural monitoring. Yet, the S-band also shows great potential for such applications due to its better penetration and sensitivity to crop structural features. Its usage, however, is still limited by the relatively small number of available S-band sensors.

Looking ahead, the development of diverse SAR sensors across multiple frequency bands, along with the launch of more SAR-equipped satellites, is expected to further expand the potential applications of SAR technology across a wide range of fields.
