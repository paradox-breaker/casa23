## Summary

### Context

South Africa is a semi-arid country with an average annual rainfall of less than 500 mm. It experiences high evaporation rates, low precipitation, and significant spatial and temporal variability in rainfall distribution. The vast majority of the country’s water supply relies on surface water sources.

Cape Town, located on the southwestern coast of South Africa, depends on six major dams that provide more than 95% of the city’s water supply. Between 2016 and 2017, water stress in Cape Town intensified, making it one of the major cities in the world facing the risk of "Day Zero"—a scenario where the public water supply system would be shut down. Eventually, through a series of measures such as restricting household water usage, increasing water tariffs, and implementing water-saving campaigns, the city’s water crisis was temporarily alleviated [@Bi2020].

### Policies

In the Universal Sustainable Development Goals, SDG 6 highlights that water demand is steadily rising due to population growth, urbanization, and other factors. However, many countries currently face water scarcity and the degradation of water-related ecosystems. To address these challenges, investment in infrastructure, ecosystem protection, and hygiene education are essential to ensure universal and affordable access to safe drinking water by 2030. [SGD6](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/water-and-sanitation/)

The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction explicitly emphasizes the use of geospatial information technologies to compile and regularly update local disaster risk information, and to disseminate this information to affected communities, the general public, and decision-makers. It also calls for the integration of disaster risk assessment, mapping, and management into planning processes in areas prone to droughts and floods. [Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030](https://www.undrr.org/publication/sendai-framework-disaster-risk-reduction-2015-2030)

Following the Day Zero crisis, Cape Town introduced the Cape Town Water Strategy, which promotes responsible water use through pricing mechanisms and aims to diversify water sources through projects such as water reuse, desalination, and groundwater extraction. The goal is to build a water-sensitive and resilient city. [Cape Town Water Strategy](https://www.capetown.gov.za/general/cape-town-water-strategy)

## Application

To address the drought issue in Cape Town, remotely sensed data can be used to regularly assess drought conditions in the region. This enables timely actions to be taken in order to mitigate the impact of drought on domestic and agricultural water use.

Specifically, Landsat 8 imagery can be used to classify annual land cover in Cape Town. Based on this classification, the surface area of water bodies and vegetation can be calculated, and changes in their extent can be monitored to help determine the severity of drought. Additionally, various indices can be employed to provide a more comprehensive assessment [@orimoloye2019].

: Indices for Drought Detection

## Reflection

By reviewing various international, metropolitan, and local policy documents, I have found that remote sensing products can effectively support local governments in implementing global goals. These global goals are often indicative, abstract and lack context-specific operational guidance. As a result, during implementation, technical staff may struggle to identify the gap between the current situation and the targets, as well as where the practical entry points lie. Remote sensing helps bridge this gap by providing quantitative assessments through a range of indices and by utilizing multi-temporal data for disaster monitoring and early warning. This enables cities to allocate resources more efficiently and develop more equitable planning interventions. Furthermore, remote sensing can offer feedback on local policy implementation, provide evidence of effectiveness, and support policy adjustments.

I have also noticed that remote sensing and GIS tools are increasingly integrated into urban development agendas. For example, the Sendai Framework explicitly encourages the use of geospatial technologies to compile and regularly update risk information, with the aim of enhancing disaster risk understanding and promoting early warning.

However, I have come to realize that there are practical limitations to remote sensing data. Taking drought detection as an example, I tend to prefer high-resolution data because my study area is at the city scale, where low-resolution data may reduce the accuracy of analysis. On the other hand, disaster monitoring relies heavily on timeliness, which leads me to consider products with shorter revisit cycles, such as MODIS. Yet, spatial and temporal resolution are often difficult to balance—this is a classic challenge in the practical application of remote sensing.
